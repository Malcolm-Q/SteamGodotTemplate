# Steam Godot Template
This project uses [Gramps' GodotSteam addon](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam) and [Expresso Bits' SteamMultiplayerPeer addon](https://github.com/expressobits/steam-multiplayer-peer).  
Made with Godot 4.3  
This project contains a main menu with saved and applied settings, the ability to create and join LAN servers, and the ability to create and join Steam servers.  
Invite friends directly through Steam.  
Will work for a 2D or 3D project.  

My goal for this is for it to eliminate as much boilerplate code as possible while still being easy to modify / personalize.

Creates 4 player lobbies by default. Does not include lobby browser. Lobbies are friends only by default.  
I may create a branch with a lobby browser but I don't use them in my own games so we'll see.  
UI is controllable via controller, mouse, or keyboard.

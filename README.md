# Steam Godot Template
This project uses [Gramps' GodotSteam addon](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam) and [Expresso Bits' SteamMultiplayerPeer addon](https://github.com/expressobits/steam-multiplayer-peer).  
Made with Godot 4.3  
This project contains a main menu with saved and applied settings, the ability to create and join LAN servers, and the ability to create and join Steam servers.  
Invite friends directly through Steam.  
Will work for your 2D or 3D project.  

My goal for this is for it to eliminate as much boilerplate code as possible while still being easy to modify / personalize.
